#if we start from the begining of array, there is a chance we may lose the sorting
#[5 6 7 0 0 0] [2 3 4] -> second array can become [5 3 4], we are losing sorting
# so start from where there is no issue of overwriting. we won't lose sorted order. so
# collect and put to the last. Collecting pointer from last.
# Collecting point shud start from the end, if it stars from the begining the we can  lose sorting.
# comparing pointers start from the end as well bcuz bigger no can go to the end.
