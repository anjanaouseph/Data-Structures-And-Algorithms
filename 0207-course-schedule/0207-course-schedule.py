    # Points to be Noted:
    # Returning True for visited:
    # If a node is already visited, it means the node and all its neighbors have been processed without detecting a   cycle. Since we are traversing a directed graph, visiting a node that has already been completed in a previous traversal is harmless and doesn't create a cycle.

    # Returning False for visiting:
    # If a node is in the visiting state, it means we are encountering it again within the same DFS call stack. This indicates a back edge, meaning a cycle has been found. We return False to signal that a cycle exists.

#     In a tree:

# The number of edges is always V - 1, which is proportional to V.
# Therefore, E â‰ˆ V, and the time complexity simplifies to O(V) instead of O(V + E).
# In contrast, for general graphs, E can vary significantly and may be much larger than V, which is why both V and E are explicitly included in the time complexity for graph DFS.For DFS in a tree:

# Total time is O(V) + O(V - 1) = O(2V - 1) = O(V).
