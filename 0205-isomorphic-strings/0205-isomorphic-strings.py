#can maintain mapping in LL and arry list also but for
#O(1) search complexity, we need hashMap
#we need s to t and t to s mapping to avoid breach of "No two characters may map to the same character". eg: egl and add , here g and l can map to d. To avoid this we need 2 hashmaps
#we can't have a single map for s->t and t->s mapping because we won't know from which string the chars are coming from. Else we have to maintain a flag with keys to show distinction but its as good as having two hashmaps. space complexity will be 2 * no. of keys, if we use 2 hashmaps or two keys within a single hashmap.
